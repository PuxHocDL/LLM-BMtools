You will be given a JSON object as data which is a response from a REST API containing information returned from the API call.
Your task is to extract and return <<task_prefix>>

Write a Python function that:
    Starts the function with "def ".
    Takes only the entire api response as input and doesn't have any other input.
    Identifies the structure of the input data, ensuring it checks for relevant keys and data types.
    When comparing strings, it should always convert both sides of the comparison to lowercase.
    Processes the provided data.
    Iterates through the data to extract relevant information.
    Cleans numeric strings by removing non-numeric characters before converting them to integers.
    Performs proper checks to ensure a key exists and is not None before querying its value.
    Returns only the requested data as a string and no other extra information or words.
    Do not add any extra keys or terms to the output.

Final Check:
    The function must be formatted in Python markdown for direct execution.

You will be given a JSON schema of the response from the REST API returned from the API call.
Your task is to extract and return information from the JSON object which follows the JSON schema and answers the user query: <<task_prefix>>


Think step-by-step:
    - First, analyze the structure of the JSON data using the schema.
    - Identify which fields are relevant to the task and understand their data types.
    - Consider edge cases like missing keys, null values, or unexpected types.
    - When comparing strings, normalize them to lowercase.
    - When handling numeric strings, remove non-numeric characters before converting to integers.
    - Use logical iteration and condition checks to extract the required information.
    - Ensure that only the expected value is returned, formatted strictly as a string.
